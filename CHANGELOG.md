## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The package is built with hatchling instead of poetry-core, and developed with uv instead of
  Poetry. The wheel contains the same files as before. The source distribution holds the package, the
  readme and the licence, plus the repository's `.gitignore`, which hatchling includes so that a
  build from it leaves out the same files. It no longer carries the two `README.md` files from
  `tests/` and `example/`.
- The test suite also runs against Django 6.1.

### Added

- Add `extrakwargs` parameter to `{% icon %}` template tag allowing a mapping of attributes to be merged with direct kwargs (direct kwargs override collisions).
